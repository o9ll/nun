                    Rec Room was a virtual reality social game where millions of players created rooms,
                    played games, and made friends across PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Meta Quest, and more.
                    After a decade of bringing people together, Rec Room Inc. ceased operations on June 1, 2026.
